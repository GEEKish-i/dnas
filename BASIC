  <h1> HELLO </h1>
  <p>Ive created this site to explain a python project that performs basic processes like translation, transcription etc on a DNA sequence. I have also linked the program 
to NCBI Database using the biopython library to compare the given DNA sequence with actual sequences recorded in the database!</p>
